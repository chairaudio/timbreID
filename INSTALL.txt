timbreID version 0.7 requires the FFTW library, available at http://www.fftw.org.

FFTW must be compiled in single precision. To do so on a Macintosh, configure FFTW like this:

./configure CFLAGS=“-arch i386 -arch x86_64” --enable-float

and like this on Linux:

./configure CFLAGS=“-fPIC” --enable-float


By default, the FFTW library (i.e., libfftw3f.a) should be installed to /usr/local/lib. Once it is properly built and installed, you can make timbreID from within the src directory by running:

make tIDLib.o all

You must specify the location of your Pure Data source code directory in the Makefile.
