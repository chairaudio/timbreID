### about timbreID ###

timbreID is a single binary external library that contains many different Pd objects. To use it, you must tell Pd to load the timbreIDLib binary file at startup via Pd's "Preferences/Startup" dialog. To do so, make a new startup path in the Startup dialog, and provide the path to the timbreIDLib binary in this directory. Note that you must not list the extension of the timbreIDLib file (i.e., pd_linux, pd_darwin, or dll). For example:

/home/yourname/pd_libs/timbreID/timbreIDLib

Once you have listed the path to timbreIDLib in the Startup dialog, you must quit and restart Pd. If timbreID is loaded successfully, you will see a message in Pd's post window stating the timbreID version number.




### using FFTW ###

timbreID version 0.7 uses the FFTW library, available at http://www.fftw.org.

FFTW is included pre-compiled with timbreID's Windows binary package available through deken. It's fine to simply leave libfftw3f-3.dll in the timbreID directory for use as a shared library. For Linux and Macintosh, FFTW is statically linked with the timbreIDLib.

If you are building FFTW yourself, it must be compiled in single precision for use with timbreID. To do so in Linux, configure FFTW like this:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

and like this on a Macintosh:

./configure CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" --enable-float

and like this on a Raspberry Pi:

./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" --enable-float

Then run:

make
sudo make install

On Linux and Macintosh, the FFTW library files should be installed to /usr/local/lib by default.




### building timbreID from source ###

As of timbreID 0.7.8, pd-lib-builder is used for building: 

https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder

Once you have installed pd-lib-builder, you must specify its location at the bottom of the Makefile in this directory. Then (if FFTW is also built/installed), you can make timbreID by typing "make" in this directory. 

On Linux and Macintosh, timbreIDLib will statically link the FFTW library. On Windows, you will either have to set up an environment variable to point to the location of libfftw3f-3.dll, or simply put libfftw3f-3.dll directly in the timbreID directory.

The FFTW library for Windows is available precompiled at:

http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

You will need the 32-bit version, and the single precision version specifically. Their provided zip file contains several compiled versions of FFTW, but only libfftw3f-3.dll is required for timbreID version 0.7.
