# timbreID

timbreID is a library of audio analysis externals for Pure Data. The classification external [timbreID] accepts arbitrary lists of audio features and attempts to find the best match between an input feature and previously stored training instances. Besides doing identification, timbreID is also designed to facilitate real-time concatenative synthesis and orderings of sound sets based on timbre. timbreID dates back to 2009, and became available as a github repository as of version 0.7 in 2017.
